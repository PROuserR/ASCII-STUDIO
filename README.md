#ASCII STUDIO

Welcome to ASCII-STUDIO here,I made this project in my free time escaping from college, I will help you understand this project and the code:
<br/>1- This project is clearly written in C and it uses ncurses lib for its graphics and it's compiled using gcc (on linux)
<br/>2- It can animate stuff so you can make like sort of gif,the test folder is just to try the app like quick start
<br/>3- The main code is written in loop.c and funcs.h is second file to provide some little functions
<br/>4- If you are intrested in code open it.It's simple and it's all explained

<br/>5- To start hit ./ascii-studio ./test/file1
