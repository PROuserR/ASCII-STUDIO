#ASCII STUDIO

Welcome to ASCII-STUDIO here,I made this project in my free time escaping from college, I will help you understand this project and the code:
<br/>1- This project is clearly written in C and it uses ncurses lib for its graphics and it's compiled using gcc (on linux)
<br/>2- It can animate stuff so you can make like sort of gif,the test folder is just to try the app like quick start
<br/>3- The main code is written in loop.c and funcs.h is second file to provide some little functions
<br/>4- If you are intrested in code open it.It's simple and it's all explained
<br/>5- To start hit ./ascii-studio ./test/file1 ./test/file2 ./test/file3
<br/>6- To compile the project hit gcc -lncurses loop.c funcs.h -oascii-studio
<br/>7- You need to have ncurses so you can compile,your distro provider should have it
